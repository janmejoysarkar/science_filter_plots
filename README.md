# Science filter profiles

Repository maintained to create SUIT science filter transmission profiles from ascii files of recorded lab data.
Data recorded at SAG-ISITE with Andor Shamrock 500i spectrograph.


## Release Notes:
- NB2A_7 tilt data did not have -3 degree fitler measurement. A dark data has been copied as f_-3deg_{1..3}.asc to be used as placeholders.
- 2024-06-27: Temperature shift has been made to 0. Filter usage temperature and measurement temperature are the same (21 deg C). Delta T is 0.
